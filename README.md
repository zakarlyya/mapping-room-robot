## Project Description
This repository contains the code for an autonomous robot that maps a room by following the walls. The robot scans the room using an ultrasonic sensor that can pan and traverses the wall turning as needed. The walls are detected as points which are saved to the robot and published to any listening clients including a server which displays the points in real-time as shown in the example below:
